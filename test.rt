## Mandatory section
# real numbers include the value INF as a substitute for infinity
# RGB is any set of precisely three comma-separated integers limited to the range {0,1,2,...,255} inclusive
# vec3 is any set of precisely three comma-separated real numbers (i.e: -42.0,0,42.0)
# norm is any set of precisely three comma-separated real numbers making up a unit vector
# ambient lighting, float [0.0,1.0] - RGB
A 0.1 0,42,255

# camera, vec3 pos - norm orientation - int FOV

# light, vec3 pos - float brightness [0.0,1.0] - RGB

# plane, vec3 pos - norm orientation - RGB

## Bonus section
# you can model any given superquadric using its general function:
# |x/A|^r + |y/B|^s + |z/C|^t = 1
# as long as r >= 0, s >= 0, t >= 0 the shape will be finite. as soon as
# any of them is allowed to become negative, we are touching superhyperboloids
# Special cases
# if r = s = t = 2 then the figure is a sphere
# if r = s = t = 1 then the figure is an octahedron
# if r = s then the figure is some sort of superellipsoid

# superquadric, vec3 pos - float r - float s - float t - float A - float B - float C - RGB
